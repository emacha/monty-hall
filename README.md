# Monty Hall

Just a simulation I created to work through the Monty Hall problem and a variation I came [upon](https://x.com/shachaf/status/1875996474913489352).

## Usage

- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Run `uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emacha/monty-hall/refs/heads/main/monty.py`

Or clone the repo, changes the `options` to play around with different numbers of doors and prizes behind.
